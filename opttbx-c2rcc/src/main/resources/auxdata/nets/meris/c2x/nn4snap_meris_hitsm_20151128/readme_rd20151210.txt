NN for high concentrations of TSM and adg

Note:
the following NNs are still based on the standard bio-optical model
and are taken from the standard suite of NNs:

-rw_kd
-iop_unciop
-iop_uncsumiop_unckd
-rw_rwnorm

they will be replaced later by NNs, which are trained with the bio-optical model
for high concentrations

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    The optical water type classification (OWT) tool is an adaptation of a spectral based optical pre-classification
    scheme (Moore et al., 2014) that calculates clusters from in-situ spectra. These spectra have been collected by
    partners and advisors of the EU-GLaSS project and the ESA DUE CoastColour project.
